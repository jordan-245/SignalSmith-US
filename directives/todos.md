# SignalSmith To‑Dos

## Now
- [ ] Maintain continuity: keep a rolling Lead Book + Notes so each session picks up where it left off (tickers, catalysts, dilution risk, fundamentals snapshots, next check date)
- [ ] Trade Journal: append daily orders/fills + equity metrics for later review (docs/TRADE_JOURNAL.md via execution/trade_journal_update.py)
- [ ] Review swing book results weekly; tune risk params if needed
- [ ] Add price-reaction confirmation for post-earnings catalyst buys (gap/volume/close strength)
- [ ] Add better order attribution (portfolio_id on orders/fills) when schema evolves

## Later
- [ ] Backtest harness for swing + catalyst rules
- [ ] Add drawdown tracking + risk-off regime
- [ ] UI: add watchlist + earnings window flags
