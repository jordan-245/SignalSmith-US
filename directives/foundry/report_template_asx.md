# Signal Foundry — ASX Daily Report Template

## Purpose
This template defines the structure and sections for the ASX market daily report
generated by `execution/foundry/foundry_report.py`.

The ASX report uses the same structure as the US report with market-specific adjustments.

## Report Sections

### 1. Header
- Date, market (ASX), universe size, generation timestamp

### 2. Regime Summary
- Current regime label with emoji indicator
- Based on STW.AX (ASX 200 ETF) or cross-sectional market median
- Same classification: Risk-On, Risk-Off, Transitional

### 3. Top Rankings
- Top 20 tickers ranked by ensemble P(up)
- Same columns as US: Rank, Ticker, Price, P(up 1D/5D/20D), Ensemble, Tail Risk
- Prices in AUD

### 4. Catalyst Map
- Same Supabase integration as US
- ASX-specific: earnings season timing differs (Feb/Aug)

### 5. Trade Plans
- Portfolio: $5,000 AUD default (same parameter, user adjusts currency)
- Risk per trade: 2% ($100 AUD)
- Same stop/target methodology: 2x ATR stop, 3:1 R:R target
- Note: ASX tickers use `.AX` suffix in yfinance

### 6. Calibration Summary
- Same metrics: AUC, Brier Score, Hit Rate, ECE per horizon
- Separate model training on ASX data

### 7. Model Consensus
- Same structure as US

## ASX-Specific Notes

## Output Formats
- Markdown: `output/foundry/reports/ASX/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- HTML: `output/foundry/reports/ASX/YYYY-MM-DD.html`
- Latest symlinks: `latest.md`, `latest.html`

## Data Sources
- Universe: `directives/foundry/universe_asx.txt` (currently empty — MVP pending)
- All parquet paths use `market=ASX` partition

## Status
ASX pipeline is **not yet implemented** in MVP. The universe file is empty.
Once tickers are added to `universe_asx.txt`, the same pipeline will work
for ASX using the `--market ASX` flag.
