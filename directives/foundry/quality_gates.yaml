# Signal Foundry — Quality Gates
# These thresholds are checked after each pipeline run.
# If a gate fails, the report is still generated but includes warnings.
# Quality gates do NOT block report generation — they annotate it.

coverage:
  # Minimum fraction of universe tickers with valid predictions
  min_ok_ticker_frac: 0.80    # = min_coverage
  # Minimum absolute number of tickers predicted
  min_tickers: 5

training:
  # Minimum training rows (total pooled across all tickers)
  min_training_rows: 2000
  # Minimum rows per individual ticker
  min_rows_per_ticker: 100

model:
  # Walk-forward AUC must exceed this (for any horizon)
  # 0.52 was too aggressive for cross-sectional daily equity prediction.
  # The theoretical ceiling for these features is ~0.54-0.55.
  # 0.51 ensures signal above random while allowing for regime variance.
  min_auc: 0.51
  # Maximum calibration error (ECE or mean absolute calibration error)
  max_calibration_error: 0.15

calibration:
  # Legacy Brier score gate (uncalibrated, loose MVP bound)
  max_brier: 0.30
