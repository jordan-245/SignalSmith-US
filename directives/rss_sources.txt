# RSS/Atom sources (one per line)
# Goal: broad, scraper-friendly coverage for small-cap catalysts (US + Canada + Australia).
# Notes:
# - Some sources will be noisy (esp. PR wires) — we’ll control noise downstream with filters.
# - SEC feeds are high-signal but may rate-limit/block if UA/traffic looks automated.
