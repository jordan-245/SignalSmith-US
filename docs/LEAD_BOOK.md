# SignalSmith — Lead Book

Purpose: persistent shortlist of promising leads with enough context to resume quickly.

## How to use
For each name, keep:
- Ticker / Company

- Catalyst(s) + dates
- SEC / dilution radar notes (S-1/S-3/424B5/FWP; ATM/registered direct/warrants/resale)
- Yahoo fundamentals snapshot (mkt cap, PE, PS, PB, EV/EBITDA, shares/float)
- Status (watch / research / avoid / triggered)
- Next check
