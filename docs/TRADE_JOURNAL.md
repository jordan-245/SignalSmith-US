# SignalSmith — Trade Journal (append-only)

Purpose: durable review log of trading decisions + key metrics.

Each entry should answer:
- What did we do? (orders/fills)
- Why did we do it? (model/catalyst)
- What did it cost? (slippage/fees)
- What risk did we take? (position sizing)
- How did it work? (equity/position P&L over time)
