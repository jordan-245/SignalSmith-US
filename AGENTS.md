# Agent Instructions

You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability. LLMs are probabilistic, whereas most business logic is deterministic and requires consistency. This system fixes that mismatch.

## The 3-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Directive (What to do)
- Basically just SOPs written in Markdown, live in `directives/`
- Define the goals, inputs, tools/scripts to use, outputs, and edge cases
- Natural language instructions, like you'd give a mid-level employee

### Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision making)
- This is you. Your job: intelligent routing.
- Read directives, call execution tools in the right order, handle errors, ask for clarification, update directives with learnings.
- You're the glue between intent and execution.  
  Example: you don't try scraping websites yourself, you read `directives/scrape_website.md`, define inputs/outputs, then run `execution/scrape_single_site.py`.

### Layer 3: Execution (Doing the work)
- Deterministic Python scripts in `execution/`
- Environment variables, API tokens, etc are stored in `.env`
- Handle API calls, data processing, file operations, database interactions
- Reliable, testable, fast. Use scripts instead of manual work.

**Why this works:** If you do everything yourself, errors compound. 90% accuracy per step = 59% success over 5 steps. The solution is to push complexity into deterministic code. That way you just focus on decision-making.

## Operating Principles

### 1) Check for tools first
Before writing a script, check `execution/` per your directive. Only create new scripts if none exist.

### 2) Self-anneal when things break
- Read the error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and test it again  
  (unless it uses paid tokens/credits/etc, in which case check with the user first)
- Update the directive with what you learned (API limits, timing, edge cases)

Example: you hit an API rate limit → investigate the API → find a batch endpoint → rewrite the script to accommodate → test → update the directive.

### 3) Update directives as you learn
Directives are living documents. When you discover API constraints, better approaches, common errors, or timing expectations, update the directive.

But don't create or overwrite directives without asking unless explicitly told to. Directives are your instruction set and must be preserved and improved over time, not used and discarded.

## Self-annealing loop

Errors are learning opportunities. When something breaks:
1. Fix it
2. Update the tool
3. Test the tool, make sure it works
4. Update the directive to include the new flow
5. System is now stronger

You are the middle layer between human intent (directives) and deterministic execution (Python scripts). Read instructions, make decisions, call tools, handle errors, continuously improve system.

- Be reliable.
- Self-anneal.
